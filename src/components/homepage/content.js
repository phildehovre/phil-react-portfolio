      Originally from Belgium, I moved to London in 2010 after completing a Bachelor's degree in Human Ressources Management. <br /><br />
      I am a self-taught JS React/Redux developer but until recently, I was a professional freelance bass player. I played for top-rated UK functions bands for wedding, parties, corporate events as well as performed alongside a great number of independant artists in Europe, Asia and Africa. <br />

      I started studying web development in June of 2020 during the first lockdown in the UK. <br />
      I followed free html, CSS and JS courses on FreeCodeCamp.com, CodeSmith.com and testing myself on LeetCode. <br/>
      I was then encouraged to learn the React framework and assorted libraries (Redux, Redux-Form, Redux-Router) by taking Stephen Grider's full React/Redux course on Udemy, which I recently completed.
      I am capable of developing well-designed, user-friendly and intuitive web applications. You will find some examples of my projects by clicking the link below. <br />

      At this moment in time, I am trying my hand at different technologies of the full-stack. <br />I love designing UI and creating smooth and satisfying UX. I am just starting a Node.js course on Udemy and will incorporate it in this portfolio in due time. <br />
      This section is still under construction as I am working on the back-end. Thank you for your understanding! In the meantime, you can contact me through my e-mail address, on the top right corner, or by following any of the links at the bottom of this page.
