      Tasteify here is some new development of a brand new concept called "Tastify". The idea behind this app is to promote the "good living" or "hygge".
      Most people do not yet benefit from the knowledge that the capacity for the human brain to enjoy food increases by orders of magnitude if paired with the perfect music to go along with the consumption.
      Food is more than just taste and should be coupled with all other sensorial experiences to completely transform the experience of eating.
